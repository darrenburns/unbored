# Unboard

## Introduction

A simple terminal client for [the Board API](https://www.boredapi.com/).
Written in Python and with [Textual](https://textual.textualize.io/).

## Warning

Still a bit of a work-in-progress. I do aim to finish tidying this up so
it's easily installable.

## TODO

- [ ] Allow for rearranging items in the list.
- [ ] Tidy up the small issues with how the filters appear.
- [ ] Add support for links when they're associated with an activity.
- [ ] Error checking. LOTS of error checking.
- [ ] Better handle the "nothing matches the filter" situation.
